# zf_check

A minimalist error handling approach that enables unobtrusive yet rigorous error checking in C.
Inspired by and builds upon [zf_log](https://github.com/wonder-mice/zf_log). Though designed to work
well with `zf_log`, you do not need to use it to use `zf_check`.

# Purpose

Correct coding in C is very difficult. Error handling in C is painfully manual. This module is
designed to encourage good coding practices by lowering the barrier to perform thorough error
handling.
